JavaScript is a versatile, high-level programming language used primarily for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. It runs in the browser and allows developers to manipulate HTML and CSS, handle events, validate forms, create animations, and interact with web servers via APIs.

Key concepts covered in a basic JavaScript tutorial include:

Variables and Data Types: var, let, const, and data types like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, and objects.

Operators and Expressions: Arithmetic, comparison, logical, and assignment operators.

Control Structures: Conditional statements (if, else, switch) and loops (for, while, do...while).

Functions: Function declarations, expressions, arrow functions, and scope.

DOM Manipulation: Accessing and modifying HTML elements using document.getElementById, querySelector, etc.

Events: Adding interactivity through event listeners (e.g., onclick, onchange).

ES6 Features: Modern syntax like template literals, destructuring, classes, and modules.

JavaScript is essential for front-end development and can also be used on the server side with environments like Node.js.
